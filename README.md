# Memory Button LED Strip
This is a simple interactive strip of buttons that functions as one part of a play control panel.

The plan is to use an Adafruit Feather M4 Express to read button inputs (possible through an MCP23017) and play sounds and light LEDs in response.

The buttons are two each of four different colors, and there are two LEDs on the strip for each button.
The LEDs corresponding to a button aren't directly over it, and there is a bit of a memory game involved if you want to have all the LEDs lit at the same time.
